# docker-other-transcode-wrapper
Simple Bash wrapper for the docker version of other-transcode

This is designed to make running the docker version of other-transcode as easy to run as the native version of other-transcode. Simply run this script as if it were the native version, passing any arguments you wish and these will be converted into the appropriate docker command and executed.

The only feature not supported is multiple input files, this wrapper is limited to one input file.
